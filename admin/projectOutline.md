# Project Outline

## Mission 
Build an algorithm to predict a perfect bracket

### Steps 
1. Engineer an organized data set
2. Determine KPI's 
3. Develop algorithm
4. Present our final product using data visualization tools

### Defining a perfect bracket 
The odds for a perfect bracket are 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (1 in 9 quintillion). </br>

We must identify what we are trying to accomplish. This can include but not limited to </br>
- predicting as many correct upsets as possible 
- predicting a correct final four and champion
